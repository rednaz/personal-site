                <h2>Bremusa of Stella</h2>

                <p>Setareh, the land of stars.  Legends state that the mountain top used to be so high that you could reach other worlds.  The mountain range itself was even in the shape of a star.  While many different villages and towns were founded all along the ranges themselves, none were built along the center: an active volcano.  Some ventured to the volcano for the thrill or historical purposes, but only one group actually decided to live around the volcano.  Considered both brave and stupid for doing so, this group was aptly referred to as the Barbarians of Setareh.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately after many decades, the lifestyle finally caught up with them.  Considered an unspeakable tragedy, almost the entire tribe was claimed by the mountain.  While hunting, new ruptures erupted near the base of the mountain, catching the barbarians off guard.  They attempted to escape, but it seemed as fate had them trapped as new pockets of magma appeared at every turn.  One barbarian was, ironically, lucky enough to be thrown from the path by a burst of compressed gas.  She landed dozens of feet down the mountain side, knocking her unconscious.</p>
                <p>She awoke from the ordeal hours later, laying upon a hill that was high enough to keep her from streams of cool lava that were still flowing down the mountain.  She looked at the ravage hillside to survey the damage.  The dozens of new pockets had already been sealed by cooled magma.  Sadly, there were no other survivors.</p>
                <p>As she looked upon the mountain, she felt as though something was calling to her.  Part of her thought it was her wanting to join the others in the next life.  But the more she stared at the mountain, the more she began to see an image in the mountain.  She heard something, a women surrounded in flames, but could not understand.  The more she gazed upon the women, the more her gaze focused on the ring that she was wearing.  She became memorized by the ring, glowing red and brighter and brighter, as if it was filled with...</p>
                <p>Startled, she turned around readying her sword.  She realized that her posture was so serene that a bird had landed on her shoulder.  She also noticed that she had moved towards the mountain and had nearly walked into the river of lava.  Back at the volcano, the image she saw was gone, but she was filled with a new sensation.  Something was calling her north.  North of the volcano, far from the home she once knew.  She began her trek, still covered in soot and ash.  Climbing the northern mountain range, villagers found out what had happened to the tribe of Setareh.  Many realized that she was the sole survivor and began calling her Bremusa, the Barbarian of Setareh.</p>
