                <h2>Dotty Snow</h2>

                <p>Growing up  was never easy for Dotty.  This was  mostly his own fault though.  The only  thing that was actually rough for him was growing up without a father.  Being a bastard was probably the reason why  he decided to be a smartass though.  Like  most boys in similar situations, he would act out due to the fact that he  didn&rsquo;t have a father figure.  Unlike most  boys though, he mostly stuck to harmless mischief.  After all, he was only looking for attention,  not hatred.</p>
                <p>Dotty was  also told that he could make a great wizard one day.  Unfortunately that person didn&rsquo;t know that  Dotty would get himself kicked out of most of the wizard colleges amongst the  northern plains and the forests.  He was  smart enough that every college wanted to train him, but that number greatly  decreased when he focused more on causing antics with his newly learned spells  than actually learning.  It got to the  point that no school would accept him, which was perfectly fine in his eyes.</p>
                <p>It was  around this time that he had heard rumors about his father.  His late father as it turned out.  A story came around that he had another son  that was living in a town on the far side of the forest.  Intrigued, he joined a group of traders who  were selling various items all over the continent and were also heading in his  direction.  While he would never actually  meet him, Dotty was glad that he may finally know who his father was.</p>
                <p>When the  caravan finally arrived at the city, Dotty began his search to see if the  rumors were true.  One thing was true,  the so called son did live in the town, at least until his house was accidently  burnt down.  The only information he  could gather was that the man he was looking for was traveling south with a new  companion.</p>
                <p>Happy to know that he may be close to some answers, he pressed on without the caravan that he had traveled with.  His gut kept telling him that traveling alone was wrong, but he kept going.  A few days of traveling led him to a clearing and he had realized that he had just stumbled upon a large Orc and Goblin camp.  He looked around and noticed that there were tons of them, and that they had captured many prisoners.  He turned around, hoping he could get away to get help when he saw two orcs standing in front of him.  He smiled at them awkwardly before they knocked him out.</p>
