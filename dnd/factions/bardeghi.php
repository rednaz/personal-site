                <p>Very Little is known about the Bardeghi and their goal.  All that has been confirmed is that they have been kidnapping civilians for months.  It is currently assumed that due to a run-in with the Sarbazeh Nur's 7th Division that the Bardeghi are accelerating their plans.</p>

                <p><a href="../characters/index.php">The Party</a>: The Bardeghi seemed to have bitten off more than they could chew when they first kidnapped the individual members of the party.  The Bardeghi know that a small force has been medling in their plans and have been trying to gather information on them.</p>
                <p><a href="../sarbazeh-nur.php">The Sarbazeh Nur</a>:The Bardeghi's forces are quite large and were able to completely wipe out the Sarbazeh Nur's 7th Division.  It wasn't their intention to take out the troops, but the division was about to stumble upon their now abandoned hidden base and took action.  Unfortunately this had brought uneeded attention onto them and they tortured the only two surviving members for information and decided to accelerate their plans.</p>
