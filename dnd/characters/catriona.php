                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>Catr&iacute;ona  grew up with three brothers: one was ten years her elder, the second was eight  years her elder, and the youngest was five years younger than she. As a  consequence of this, she tended to be more of a tomboy in her attitude, yet as  the only daughter of the family she was also pampered as the little princess  which also shows through her attitude occasionally.</p>
                <p>When Catr&iacute;ona was eleven years old  her eldest brother, Baltair was slain in combat (preferably in war, but I don't  know if that suits your world/story). Her second oldest brother, Donaidh, was  enlisted in the military two years later but has not been seen or heard for  pandamore years. Catr&iacute;ona had always been protective of her younger brother,  Luthais, but due to what happened to her elder brothers, she has been extremely  protective of him as of late. </p>
                <p>Her family has lived among the  wilderness for several decades, so she often found herself wandering around the  local forests, so she gained an appreciation for nature at an early age. She was even able to take a sick pup into her  care and nursed it back to help. This  lead to her being discovered as a natural druid, and both Catr&iacute;ona and her wolf  companion Izanami joined the Bashkoh military. </p>
                <p>Catr&iacute;ona was assigned to a unit at a  liaison post between the western borders of Esraag and the forests of Bashkoh. The assignment was mostly boring. Some patrols, but no aggression ever  happened. One day, a rumor started going  around camp about a possible sighting of an AWOL soldier. The camp began to take life, as Catr&iacute;ona&rsquo;s  leaders began arguing about what to do about the rumor. The rumor became so important that her  platoon prepared to leave immediately. Before  heading out, she was summoned by her commander.  It turned out that most of arguing about the rumor was about her. Apparantly, it was about Donaidh. After pandamore years it seemed that there was  information that he had turned up.</p>
                <p>Catr&iacute;ona insisted that she&rsquo;d be  part of the search. Canthalion, didn&rsquo;t  trust that she wouldn&rsquo;t, and said that it would be best that she&rsquo;d be left out  due to her personal relationship with the rumor. However, the cleric deemed that if she would  follow her orders to the letter and not let her emotions take control of the  situation, then she could come. With  that agreement, they all traveled south into the desert…</p>
                <p>Three days  into the desert was already starting to take its toll on the group. The summer heat was too much for some of the  platoon, and the entire group was unable to make as much progress as they were  hoping to. They were still a week away  from their destination, but they had already believed that if Donaidh was there  that he had left a week before they did.  The only goal was to verify if the information was true. Unfortunately, they would never make it to  their original destination.</p>
                <p>At half  past noon, Catr&iacute;ona stopped. Something  didn&rsquo;t feel right. The wind had died  down all of a sudden, yet she could still hear it moving. Izanami, now full grown, began growling at a  stench in the air. The cleric stopped  the party, but was already too late to react.  The two leading scouts had already been taken out by arrows.</p>
                <p>Outnumbered  by Orcs, the platoon tried to fight back.  One by one they began to fall, and Catr&iacute;ona felt that all was lost. The only thing that she could think of doing  was to save the only one that could escape the battle. She told Izanami to flee. After doing so, Catr&iacute;ona was knocked over the  head and, just before losing consciousness, saw the wolf run back towards the  forest...</p>
